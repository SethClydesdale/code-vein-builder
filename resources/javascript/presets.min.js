Though if you prefer, you can switch out Chaotic Ash for a different active Gift of your choice.<br><br>The biggest weakness of this build is its relatively low defenses. This build can be described as a bit of a \"Glass Cannon.\" Eating attacks isn't really recommended. Especially if you choose a different Drain weapon with the Slow mobility. If you feel you're not too good with dodging in general, you can swap out Chaotic Ash for Cleansing Light to offset possible damage taken.<br><br>Side note, the weapons listed were primarily chosen for the \"Fashion\" sense while also being practical. For a little more effectiveness for the weapon damage and Drain rating, a Queenslayer Bayonet (no Transformation) and a hammer with the Drain transformation serve as better alternatives if you want to maximise weapon damage (for lower mobs) and Drain Rating respectively. However, keep in mind that one weapon MUST be of the Quick mobility to ensure Swift Destruction's damage is at its max. Plus, it does cover a lot of ground when dodging, so it doesn't hurt having the extra mobility.<br><br>The Veil being of Intensification transformation, if only barely, allows weapon Mobility to be better while also giving more damage (even if it's only 4 points), so it is important.<br><br>Nagimukro Drain is legit a personal choice. It's the best blend of style, drain, and damage at the cost of Mobility. But it has managed to serve well. If you want a Normal-mobility high-Drain weapon, your choices are either Sunset Greatsword, or Heavy Axe.","u/arachnidsGrip88|fejk3r6"],"The Twilight Mage":["IIRgLAPsAcEAwQCKWJBDQDYq2ATihAFZCB2KAZgCYoqRbIBhKiiR4pKhZqoA","This mage heavily focuses on dark gifts. Specifically lightning based spells. With Jupiter's Blade for close range to Perkunas for long range power, this mage is capable of casting very strong spells. Although Twilight is bugged, it's still nice to cast it and see it in action in my opinion. <a href='https://youtu.be/ENGzvxUcWek' target='_blank'>https://youtu.be/ENGzvxUcWek</a><br><br>This build uses survival instincts as it powers up your spells so having feral tenacity allows you to better use that passive while you also have a powerup from swift destruction and dark shout, though dark shout only works for one attack. I prefer to use it on Perkunas but it also works well on Twilight. Feral Tenacity also lasts until you take fatal damage so I always have it activated before I start any run with this build.<br><br>Iceblood is very light and allows you to be quick so you can benefit completely from swift destruction. It may not do the highest damage and the Argent Wolf out classes it but it's moveset still gets the job done as far as ichor collecting goes and it has a powerful regular strong attack, which is something I use often.<br><br>Overall this build has great damage, good survivability, and reliable mobility.","u/IC_Ivory280|fe38zz9"],"Vampiric Mage":["IIJgHAPsBsEAwQCIEYoBZ5VcSxkggGFltlZQNgBmAVihAE4oqnCQDDWRUAxOIA","This build focuses on attacking with both physical and magical attacks.
